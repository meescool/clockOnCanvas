# Clock on Canvas

This repo stores a web page that shows a real time clock. 
You can see the end result here: https://clockoncanvas.meescool.repl.co/

## Technologies used
Developed with the Canvas element of HTML5 and JavaScript. 

## How to run
In order to run correctly, you need to have a web server. I use Servez, by greggman. Here is a link if you're interested in using it too: https://greggman.github.io/servez/

<!-- ## Diagram
I created this diagram when trying to visualize the trigonometric solution when working on this project.
