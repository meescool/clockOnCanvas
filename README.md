# Clock on Canvas

This repo stores a web page that shows a real time clock.

## Technologies used
Developed with the Canvas element of HTML5 and JavaScript. 

## How to run
In order to run correctly, you need to have a web server. I use Servez, by greggman. Here is a link if you're interested in using it too.
